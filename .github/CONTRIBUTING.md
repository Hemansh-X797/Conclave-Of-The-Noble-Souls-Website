## Code Style and Best Practices

We strive to maintain consistent coding standards and clean code practices. When contributing, please follow the guidelines below:

- **Use clear variable and function names**: Names should be descriptive of their purpose.

- **Format code consistently**: Use a consistent style for indentation, spacing, and line breaks. We use **Prettier** to format the code.
- **Avoid large, monolithic commits**: Break down changes into smaller, logical commits.
- **Use semantic commit messages**: For example, "fix: resolve bug in user login" or "feat: add search feature to the homepage."
