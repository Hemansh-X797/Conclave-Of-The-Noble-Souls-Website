# Conclave Of The Noble Souls Website Guide

## Creator's story-

i have recently observed a trend among people where they are making websites using *Artificial Intelligence*. and some claiming that we can do it without any prior knowledge of any form of programming. Leading to the famous question **"Will A.I. take over my job?"** to which i also wrote a book on. that aside for now, one day, out of utter curiosity, i saw one of the youtube video guides explaining "How make a website with AI without learning programming". and the website worked just fine, honestly speaking, i was intrigruied by this spectacular performance by a mere robot, and suddenly, a thought came into my mind, i first ignored it out of absolute laziness, but my mindkept screaming, it won't let me sleep, when i got to bed, i was thinking of the same thought for the entire night "if a newbie canmake a working digital product with AI, what will happen when an Expert in that field utilizes AI" and hence, i decided on embarking upon a path to see what happens when a expert utilizes A.I for his job. i wrote down many projects on a paper, a website, an application, an E-Book, a template, and much more, this one you are seeing is my website, i decided on a website, but i was confused, a website on what? a website for what? a website where? a website for whom? , all this thoughts rumbling over one another causing chaos in my brain while my body was calmly sitting on a chair talking with people in discord, i found an intrigruing botin a server and decided to add it in my discord server too, "the conclave of the noble souls", which i made for talking with my friends but it is dead now, i added and configured all bots and permissions needed for a high-end, production-grade discord server, i created and named the channels,roles and categories, i did a lot of things , i got inspiration from other servers and implemented it into mine, but my entrepreneurial-gene won't let me be normal, it wanted
me to do something new, something different, something unique, to innovate something, and hence i did innovate not 1 but 2 ideas.

### First idea {Pathways}-

covering the flaw of my discord server not being a community(i did not upgrade because my people did not want it to be a community server).which was, **pathways**, i observed what people do in discord servers, i met 3 major types of people, which were:

- people intrested in just talking
- people intrested in gaming with friends
- people intrested in anime/manhwas/mangas/manhuas/donghuas/webtoons/webnovels/light novels and books
- people who liked to share useful information with others

And so, i decided on the main pathways(i wanted to make it like LOTM system but one individual can take as many pathways as possible[till they fulfill the entering criteria]), i decided on the pathways "gaming", "lorebound" and  "productive" abd named them "The BIG 3 Pathways", but then, my nerves started to reject it again, they wanted something new again, and hence, afte that, i added the "News" pathway and named them "4 major pathways" which i included in my wensite, i then started adding more side-pathways.

### Second idea {A custom Website For My Discord server}-

My second idea, a custom website for my server, which i ws talking in the start, i finally got an idea for my website. but a website for a discord server made for just yapping? what should the website do, is it just a banner website for my server's advertisment? no, i did not want it to be that bland, so i started finding out ideas for my website, what could i include, and i found some, noted them on a paper, they were:

- including forms like staff application form, appeal form etc.
- including some fun things like a musicplayer, a MBTI test etc.
- members able to see their discord stats
- a place for mods and admins
- an art gallery
- pathway integration
- a discord bot made exclusively for my server

and i started, i knew that this was not enough webpages, so i decided to cover thaat flaw with a luxurious frontend, i started this project being aware of the fact that it might take months, and it did take, because AI my friend, is not absolute, it will do the manual labour for you, but the tasks which require creativity, you have to do yourself, not including the errors AI makes and how fabricated and detailed intricrate prompt you have to feed it, along with files making sure thata it is not too much for the AI so it does not forget what you did, and i still made, persevered, and never do our 100% work"
 more info in my book "will A.I. take my job?" also tells how to adapt yourself to work with AI.
