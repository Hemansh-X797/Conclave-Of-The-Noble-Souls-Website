### 👑 Our Mission

**The Conclave of the Noble Souls** isn't just another Discord server — it's an ecosystem for creators, lore-seekers, dreamers, and chaos bringers.
Our goal is to build a self-sustaining, semi-lorebound space with gamified progression, exclusive digital goods, and internal productivity systems that make your time worthwhile, even when you're just vibing.

We're not about clout. We're about crafting digital sanctuaries with zero paywalls, no external DBs, no annoying role gates — just value, raw and refined.

### 🔐 How Things Work

You don’t need to verify with any role. No 3rd-party APIs. No need to give up your soul. Just log in via Discord (OAuth2 only — no permissions asked), and you’re in.

We run everything server-side (and public), but with the **intent to restrict core features to this server only**. No funny business. Just clean, server-native features.

### 🔧 Developer Notes

* Currently hosted on **Vercel**, utilizing **Vercel Analytics**
* No Supabase/FireStore — keeping it lean, portable, and free
* Each component is 20KB+ in size, optimized for performance, minimal load
* Public Discord bot, but **bound to this server's ecosystem**
* Feedback and logs available soon (opt-in only)

Expect better integrations over time, including:

* 📊 Server stats and project tracking
* 📘 Member-led documentation (like GitHub wiki, but server-native)
* 🧾 Personal resource pages for higher-ranked nobles
* 🔁 Lorebind mechanics (phase 2)
